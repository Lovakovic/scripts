# My Bash Scripts Collection

This repository is a collection of useful bash scripts I've created to automate various tasks on Linux systems.

## Structure

The repository is organized with each script contained in its own directory. This allows for each script to be self-contained along with any supporting documentation or additional files.

## Usage

Each script's directory contains its own README file that provides specific details about what the script does and how to use it. It is recommended to refer to these individual README files before running each script.

    Clone the repository or download the specific script you want to use.

    Navigate into the script's directory.

    Make the script executable with the command `chmod +x scriptname.sh`.

    Run the script as per the instructions provided in its README file.

## Contribution

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for any improvements or new scripts you'd like to contribute. Ensure that any new scripts are placed in their own directory and include a README file.

## License

Unless stated otherwise, the scripts in this repository are free to use and modify. Please check the README file in each script's directory for any specific licensing information.

## Disclaimer

While I strive to make these scripts as reliable and useful as possible, they are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Always review and test scripts before using them in a production environment.
